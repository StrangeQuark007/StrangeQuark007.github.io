I am a physicist jointly affiliated with Columbia University and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. My research focuses on the analytic structure of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory, with an emphasis on their connection to physical observables relevant to high-energy phenomenology. 

I completed my PhD at McGill University under the supervision of Simon Caron-Huot, where I developed analytic and geometric tools to study and compute scattering observables efficiently. 

Recently, I have been applying these methods to investigate various aspects of the high-energy asymptotics of scattering amplitudes in quantum chromodynamics (the theory of the strong interaction), which reveals important structural features of hadronic matter under extreme conditions; similar to those that prevailed in the early Universe. I am also interested in understanding better scattering processes that can lead to gravitational collapse.
